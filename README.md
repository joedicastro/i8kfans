# i8kfans

Adjust the fans speed in Dell Inspiron laptops (with a nvidia graphics card) to 
maintain the right temperatures. This affect both fans, the cpu and the gpu fan.

Based on a 2006 bash script by Wheelspin, `i8kapplet`. This old script served
faithfully me for many years, but my ears couldn't stand much longer its random
and common slow downs/speed ups. Over the years, fans have become more and more
loud. This new script runs in a more smooth way, with less sudden changes. It's
cheaper than replace booth fans, don't you think?
