"""
    i8kfans.py: Adjust the fans speed in various Dell laptops (with a nvidia
    graphics card) to maintain the right temperatures. This affect both fans,
    the cpu and the gpu fan. Originally i8k was created to run in a Dell
    Inspiron 8000 laptop, but this Dell fan control via SMM BIOS is available
    in others laptops of various series (Inspiron, XPS, Latitude, etcetera),
    but not all of them are supported. Mine is an Inspiron 9400 but I tested
    this successfully in a XPS m1330 too.

    Based on a 2006 bash script by Wheelspin, `i8kapplet`. This old script
    served faithfully me for many years, but my ears couldn't stand much longer
    its random and common slow downs/speed ups. Over the years, fans have
    become more and more loud. This new script runs in a more smooth way, with
    less sudden changes.  It's cheaper than replace booth fans, don't you
    think?

    This script needs the `i8kutils` linux package installed and the `i8k`
    kernel module loaded to work.
